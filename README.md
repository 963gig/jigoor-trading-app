## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is set up to run directly in the browser without a build step, making it very easy to get started locally.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
- A valid Google Gemini API key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
- A local web server. The easiest way is to use the **Live Server** extension for Visual Studio Code.

### Installation & Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/jigoor-trading-app.git
    cd jigoor-trading-app
    ```

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    The application needs your Gemini API key to function. We'll create a simple environment file for this.

    - Create a new file named `env.js` in the root of the project.
    - Add the following code to `env.js`, replacing `'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual key:

      ```javascript
      // env.js
      window.process = {
        env: {
          API_KEY: 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE'
        }
      };
      ```
    *This file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent you from accidentally committing your secret key.*

3.  **Run the application:**
    - Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
    - If you have the **Live Server** extension, right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
    - Your browser will open, and the application will be running locally!

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

Deploying this application is straightforward. We recommend using a service like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Deploying to Netlify

1.  **Push to GitHub:** Create a GitHub repository and push your code to it.

2.  **Create a New Site on Netlify:**
    - Log in to Netlify and select "Add new site" -> "Import an existing project".
    - Connect your GitHub account and select your repository.

3.  **Configure Settings:**
    - Netlify will likely detect that this is a static site. You can leave the "Build command" and "Publish directory" fields blank.

4.  **Set the API Key (Crucial!):**
    - In your new Netlify site's dashboard, go to **Site configuration** -> **Environment variables**.
    - Click "Add a variable".
    - For the **Key**, enter `API_KEY`.
    - For the **Value**, paste your Google Gemini API key.
    - This securely provides the API key to your application without exposing it in the code.

5.  **Deploy:**
    - Click "Deploy site". Netlify will build and host your application, providing you with a live URL.
